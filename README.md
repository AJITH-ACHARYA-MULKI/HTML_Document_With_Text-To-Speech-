We have designed a TULUNADU CULTURE website which is related to document type. In this repository we have developed a test-to-speech technology which will read out the sentence which is selected by the user. Since our project is releted to document type, it might be difficult for user to read whole document. so this TTS technology wiil be helpful for user to gather the information.
